# Pervie

Pervie is a B L A Z I N G L Y F A S T TUI in rust for reformatting storage drives and flashing ISOs from remote servers to your local drive.

Why is it called Pervie? Because it's good at flashing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

## Features

- Reformat storage drives into exFAT, FAT32, or NTFS.
- Safely unmount and eject storage drives.
- **[UNDER DEVELOPMENT]** Flash ISOs from remote servers to your local drive. No need to download the ISO to your computer first.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logscore/pervie/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

```bash
pervie
```

Some operations may fail if you don't have administrator privileges. If you get an error, try running the command again with `sudo`.
